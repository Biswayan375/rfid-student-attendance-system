# rfid-student-attendance-system
This project is about tracking and managing student attendances using IoT. We have a NodeJS server with MySQL database and
a NodeMCU (WiFi enabled) compatible board (I have used Wemos D1 R2 NodeMCU compatible board) with RFID sensor and tags/cards. The
idea is to give students the RFID tags/cards (which can be of any form like identity card) and they can use it before entering
the class to register their attendances which can be tracked and managed by the frontend application.

> ## How to spin up the server and the web application üöÄ
> - First make sure to import the SQL file in the /DB folder to constuct the database. I have used MariaDB.
> - After you have the database all setup, make sure to include a .env file inside /Web folder and write is as follows -   
> ```
> PORT=<Write the port no where you want the server to run>
> DB_NAME=rfidams
> DB_USERNAME=<Write the username of your database>
> DB_HOST=<Write the IP address of the database server or simply localhost if it is running locally>
>
> ADMIN_USERNAME=<Write the username which you want to be the username of the admin>
> ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Write the username which you want to be the username of the admin>
>
> SESSION_KEY=<vihf139487hwefbvhwergvyueirgohebwlivyloerwybvloewjvb43 or any random text that can be
> auto generated or can be generated by smashing your head on the keayboard>
> ```
> Now please don't write whatever I have told you to write in the .env file inside those angular brackets i.e.: '<' & '>'.
> For example, **do not write PORT=<3000>**, **rather write PORT=3000**. You get the gist of it üòâ
> - Now assuming you have NodeJS installed in your system, run ```npm install``` by opening a terminal inside the /Web
> directory
> - Finally run ```npm run test``` or ```node server.js``` to spin up the server. You should see a message in the terminal
> window.
> - Now open up your favourite browser and hit **localhost:<the port you have written in the .env file>** to see the application
> up and running. Use the ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD you have specified in the .env file to log into the system.

> ## How to setup the hardware device üîß
> - The circuit diagram is given in the following images. Just follow them and setup your device. After that upload the .ini
> program into your board using the arduino IDE.
> - You should run into some problems regarding some drivers and the board being unavilable if you are doing it for the very
> first time in your life. Just google the problems, they are pretty easy to fix believe me üëç
> 
> 
> ## What are the hardware ingredients üìå
> - Any NodeMCU compatible board would do. However, I have used Wemos D1 R2 not because I love that board but at that time
> only it was available to me.
> - RFID sensor along with RFID cards and tags.
> - And your sheer will.
